# About me @ahiru-t3ch :wave:
- I used to dev after my degree in "computing science and project management"
- Then I switched to "Business Analyst" and "Production Support Analyst"
- Now I'm a Freelance "Business Analyst" and "Scrum Master" working a classic 9 to 5
- But I want to dev again because I miss it to much :heart:

# My Goals :v:
- Learn a tech stack to create Micro SAAS :seedling:
- Become a fullstack dev
- Leave my 9 to 5 in a few years and live while coding Micro SAAS for small companies
- Launch my own Mirco SAAS in 2025 and drink :beer:

# My current project
