# About me @ahiru-t3ch :wave:
- I used to "Dev" after my degree in "computing science and project management"
- Then I switched to "Business Analyst" and "Production Support Analyst"
- Now I'm a Freelance "Business Analyst" and "Scrum Master" working a classic 9 to 5
- But I want to dev again because I miss it too much :heart:

# My Goals :v:
- Learn a tech stack to create Micro SAAS :seedling:
- Learn other techs like cybersecurity
- Change my 9 to 5 in a more technical job (as Dev or Cybersecurity)
- Leave my 9 to 5 in a few years and live while coding Micro SAAS and Apps
- Launch my own Mirco SAAS to have a passive income and drink :beer:
- Try to find finance freedom to support my family and work on my own projects

# My current projects
- Create my own Boilerplate using FARM with essential functionnalities to launch a SAAS :bug:
- Night classes in Cybersecurity and I subscribed on Try Hack Me platform
- Build a Fitness Reps counter in 90 days
